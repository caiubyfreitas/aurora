Boilerplate for One Pager Site

As the name suggests these files were created to be reused in projects where a single page site is needed. It relies on pure and responsive HTML, CSS and javascript snippets without any reference to external libraries or resources.

This work was based on a freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/" target="_blank">article</a> with a similar goal.

- The code was check with https://validator.w3.org and is free of errors and warnings.
- Self-closing tags were used just for XHTML compatibility.
